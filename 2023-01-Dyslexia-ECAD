Dyslexia & ECAD tools
---

Looking at ECAD tools and adapting them to make a Dyslexic's life esier

# KiCAD (6)

## Schimatic editor with a black back ground

Preferances -> Prefernces... -> Schematic Editor -> Colors

create a new "Theme" to your liking, basically "Background" is the key colour to change here.

The Symbol editor also uses the same settimgs.

## Windows in Dark Theme (Windows)
Can't find a setting for this, the OS is set to Dark but KiCAD is not, nor can I find a setting.

## Spell checker
Not found in Windows.

# Altium (22)

## Schimatic sheet editor Dark background
This apears only possible on a sheet by sheet basis

For a given sheet:

Properties -> General -> General -> Sheet Color

Possibly worrh setting things up via a sheet template if your coluiges are happy with this.
