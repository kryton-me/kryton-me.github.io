Dyslexia Browser Tips
---
Hints & tips for an easier browsingï¿¼ experience. This is mainly looking at Spellcheckers and their availability when filling in web forms. I've dabbled in the past with making browsers change how you see the site but it did not work well. If I make any progress I'll update/ link to this page.

# Safari 

## Spell checker (MacOS, iOS, & iPadOS)
Uses operating system spell checker by default.

# Firefox
As with a lot of open source software it can do it and do it well but you may need to set it up (depending on Operating System) setting it up can be quite the challenge, At least they don't make you use vim to make the changes this time).

## Spell checker (iOS)
Appears to be by default, suspect this is related to iOS

## Spell checker (Windows)
Firefox in Windows has two options that need to be enabled:

Menu button -> Settings -> General -> Language and Appearance -> Language -> "Check your spelling as you type"

check the above setting is enabled (ticked)

if it's not working try:

   about:config

accept the risk and Continue

search for spellcheck

change from 0 to 1 or 2

   layout.spellcheck.Default  2

Appears to give you full office spelling & grammer by default.

Appears to be by default, suspect this is related to iOS
