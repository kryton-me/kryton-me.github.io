BF-888s
---

I've become aware there are a lot of BF-888s radios being miss sold online in the UK as PMR446 radios which is real not the case. Intrestinly in the US I only got one hit for "BF-888s FRS", I wonder if the FCC are a bit more eiger at cracking down on thease things?

# Why arnt they PMR446 radios?

Lets compair the specficication of the Baofeng BF-888s radio to the PMR-446 specification as laid out by Ofcom. 

I believe this is the specification from the [original manufacturer website](https://www.baofengradio.co/product/BF-888S.html). This makes no mention of PMR446 but does provide a detailed specification.

Then to cross reference this to Ofcoms specification for the PMR446 standard which appears to be split across two documents;

[Ofcom’s: "Analogue and Digital PMR446 Information Sheet"](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/85156/ir_2009_analogue_and_digita1.pdf)

[Ofcom’s "IR 2030 – UK Interface Requirements 2030"](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/84970/ir-2030.pdf)

## Comparision

| Variable | PMR446
 | Reffrence | BF-888s | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power | 500 mW e.r.p. |IR2030 p75 | >= 5W | Not compatable |
| Frequency range | 446.0–446.2MHz | IR2030 p75 | 400-480MHz | covers PMR band |
| Antenna type | Integral Antenna | IR203 p8 | Lists the antenna as an accessory inferring it’s not integral | Not comoatable |
| Channel spacing | 12.5kHz (Analogue) or 6.25kHz (Digital) | Analogue and Digital PMR446 Information Sheet p4 | 25kHz or 12.5kHz | Potential compatible with analouge. |

It would appear that BF-888s radio does not conform to the PMR446 specifications laid out by Ofcom.

# Can't I just use it?
The frequencies pre installed on the radio are all over the spectrum. I can't find a list from Baofeng but a list has been published on [github by people reading their radios](https://gist.github.com/kennedy/11278351)

# Then why are they made / sold?

There are ligitimte uses for them:

If your a licensed radio amateur operating on the 70cm Ham band (430MHz to 440 MHz). 

Alternatively you hold a Business Radio (UK simple) license operating in the UHF1 alocations.
