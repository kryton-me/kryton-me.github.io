Arduino Comms
===
I often work on projects involving Arduino boards and it would be nice to get be able to communicat with them not requiring a laptop and a USB lead. The requirment here is to connect from a phone or tablet idealy with an IDE but a simply serial terminal would be sufficent.

# Potential methods of conecting to them.
Theas are my assumptions untill I can probe otherwies. 

## USB lead
Power would potentially be a problem here depending on what output the device could offer here. This may require a tablet over a phone. sadly I've yet to find anysoftware to support this approch.

## Bluetooth serial conection
There appear to be numerous apps avalable to suport a searial port over BLE.


## IOT via Arduino cloud
This sounds like the simplest but requires specific hardware to be used.
