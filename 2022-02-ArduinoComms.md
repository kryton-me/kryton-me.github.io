Arduino Comms
===
I often work on projects involving Arduino boards and it would be nice to get be able to communicate with them not requiring a laptop and a USB lead. The requirement here is to connect from a phone or tablet ideally with an IDE but a simply serial terminal would be sufficient.

# Potential methods of connecting to them.
Theas are my assumptions until I can probe otherwise. 

## USB lead
Power would potentially be a problem here depending on what output the device could offer here. This may require a tablet over a phone. sadly I've yet to find any software to support this approach.

## Bluetooth serial convection
There appear to be numerous apps available to suport a serial port over BLE.


## IOT via Arduino cloud
This sounds like the simplest but requires specific hardware to be used.
