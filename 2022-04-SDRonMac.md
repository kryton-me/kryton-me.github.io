SDR on MacOS
---
I have a basic RTL-SDR dongle I had the idea to use as a poor mans spectrum analyser. Out of intrest I thought i'd try it out as an SDR radio first to see what I can pick up and as a quick memory refresh regards radio. Researching how to set this up I discovered there's a great dearth of information about running SDR software on Apple Mac computers. I thought I'd put my notes together in the hope it my help somewone else.

# Hardware
I used a RTL-SDR blog v3

One thing to note is for anything between 500kHz to 25MHz put the dongle (RTL-SDR) in to Direct sampling Q branch. Also don't forget to put it back or you might find Short wave broadcasts appearing in 100MHz bands.

# Software Clients
I got 3 Client working on my Mac

## SDR++
By far the best, relativly easy to use (as SDR goes) and so far very reliable. the only down side being its on Mac ports not Home Brew so needs sudo to install. I have a rather uneasy feeling every time I use Mac Ports.
I have to say I do like the ability to scrole the spectrum if a signal is a few MHz away.

	sudo port install SDRPlusPlus

## Cubicsdr
Looks prity comprihensive although both my Mac and dongle got very hot when using it. 

	brew install --cask cubicsdr

## Sdrdx
Simple and easy to use, possibly a good starting point but lacks the features of other tools.

	brew install --cask sdrdx

## SDR#
Although a PC only tool I did give it a quick go on an old PC as it has lots of good reviews. Personally I struggled to a good broadcast FM signal out of it where as SDR++ did a much better job on the same PC. As for the install process, lets just say I‚Äôm sticking to my Mac, argh drivers.

# Antenna
I use an old (mid 2000's) indoor VHF TV / UHF TV / FM atenna, althouth not an obvius choice it seems to get good signals across a wide spectrum and I happened to have it to hand. I've had it working on the following bands with resnable signal quality:

* Short wave AM broadcasts 75m & up
* FM radio broadcasts
* DAB radio broadcasts
* PMR446 radio

It has two 1m ish telescopic vertically antennas and a durectional loop antenna. It has a built in amplifier with adjustable gain. I‚Äôve since built some custom antennas which are better but it was a good starting place.

# Terestrial Broadcast radio
For frequenciy allocations see the [ITU Frequency Bands allocated to Terrestrial Broadcasting Services page](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/terrestrial/broadcast/Pages/Bands.aspx)

## MF Medium Wave 
* Modulation mode: AM
* Channel spacing: 9kHz
* SDR Bandwidth: ?kHz
* Dongle mode: Direct sampling (Q branch)
* ITU bands: "Low frequency (LF) and Medium frequency (MF) Bands"
	* Upper of the two bands
* Wavelenght(s): 370m

I've not been able to pick this up, I suspect this is down to my Antenna choice.

## HF National shortwave (SW)
* Modulation mode: AM 
* Channel spacing: 5kHz
* SDR Bandwidth: 9kHz
* Dongle mode: Direct sampling (Q branch)
* ITU bands: "High Frequency (HF) Bands for national broadcasting"
* Wavelenght(s): 
	* 125m 2.4MHz
	* 90m 3.3MHz
	* 75m 4MHz
	* 60m 4.9MHz
	* 59m 5.0MHz

## HF International shortwave (SW)
* Modulation mode: AM 
* Channel spacing: 5kHz
* SDR Bandwidth: 9kHz
* Dongle mode: Direct sampling (Q branch)
* ITU bands: "High Frequency (HF) Bands for international broadcasting under RR12"
* Wavelenght(s): 
	* 49m 6MHz
	* 41m 7.3MHz
	* 31m 9.7MHz
	* 25m 12MHz
	* 22m 14MHz
	* 19m 15MHz
	* 16m 18MHz
	* 15m 19MHz
	* 13m 22MHz
	* 11m 26MHz

I found this still to be quite interesting although it seems in decline.

## VHF "FM radio"
* Modulation mode: WFM
* Channel spacing: 
* SDR bandwidth:
* Dongle mode: Direct off
* ITU bands: "Very High frequency (VHF) Bands"
* Wavelenght(s): 3m

The SDR software dose a good job of reciving thease signals with very good sound quality. Much better than DAB and some internet streams so still worth listening to.

## DAB broadcasts
* Modulation mode: DAB/DAB+
* Mux spacing: 1.712MHz
* SDR bandwidth: N/A
* Dongle mode: Direct off
* ITU bands: "Very High frequency (VHF) Bands
* Wavelenght(s): 1.5m, & 1.3m

SDR++ does not pick these up directly however you can install a dedicated piece of DAB software to decode the signals. I used welle.io.

	sudo port install welle.io

Worked really well although it listed the configuration of each stream and made it clear why DAB can sound so terrible. 32kHz sample rate on 40kbit/s AAC or 80kbit/s Mpeg 1 layer II any one?

## VHF / UHF / Satellite TV
I‚Äôve not explored this.

# 2-way radio communications
There are a few things of interest, mainly in the amateur band such as FT8 and down links from the International Space Station. Otherwise I‚Äôve only found this of interest to test out equipment I own to confirm it‚Äôs operation.

## Amature / Ham radio transmissions
For a list of amatur bands see the ITU Radio regulation site. 

* üá∫üá≥ [ITU amature radio regulations](https://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/rindex.htm)

Not entirely sure I can take the frames site seriously. Most countries then have band allocation lists with more detail and some contries have adtional bands such as the UKs 4m band. 

* üá¨üáß [Radio Society of Great Britain band plan](http://rsgb.org/main/operating/band-plans/)
* üá≥üáø [New Zeland Association of Radio Transmitters](https://www.nzart.org.nz/info/band-plan/)
* üá®üá¶ [Radio Association of Canada band plan](https://www.rac.ca/operating/bandplans/)
* üá∫üá∏ [nathional association of amature radio band plan](https://www.arrl.org/band-plan)

There are also broadcasts from the International Space Station which may be of interest.

### Ham FT8
One thing that was of interest was listening in to the FT8 protocol and seeing how far away you can pick a signal up from. I managed to pick up stations pretty much the other side of the plant from me. You will need the following software.

* Sound flower (audio loopback software)
	* developer needs authorising in the system preferences

	brew install soundflower

* SDR++ (SDR software discussed above)
	* Need to set to ‚Äúdirect sampling, Q branch‚Äù
	* 20m band seems most popular
	* Modulation = Upper Side band
	* bandwidth = 1k5
	* audio sink = Soundflour (2ch)

	sudo port install SDRPlusPlus

* WSJT-X (decoding software)
	* Audio input = soundflower (2ch)
	* Set radio as ‚ÄúHamlib NET rigctl
	* ‚ÄúLocalhost:4532‚Äù (broken at time of writing)
	* Check volume is in green

	brew install wsjtx

* Gridtracker (plot stations on a map)
	* Automatically connects to WSJT-X logs
	* Extend contact fade to 24hr to view last days worth of results.

	brew install gridtracker

## CB

* Modulation mode: FM / PM / AM / DSB / SSB
* Channel spacing: 10k
* SDR bandwidth: ?
* Dongle mode: Direct sampling (Q branch)
* band: [around 27MHz but varies by country](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio)

	* üá≥üáø [rms' allocation of CB & PRS](https://rrf.rsm.govt.nz/smart-web/smart/page/-smart/domain/licence/LicenceSummary.wdk?id=146140)
* Wavelenght(s): 11m

UK channels CB channels only permit FM/PM only

## 49MHz License free band
I used to have 2-way radios that used this band but as I belive it's mostly used for baby moniotrs now so I've not investigated. From memory you where lucky to get 10m with a resnable signal.

## LPD433
* Modulation mode: FM
* Channel spacing: 25kHz
* Max broadcast power: 0.01W
* SDR bandwidth: ?
* Dongle mode: Direct off
* band: UHF 433 to 434 MHz
* Wavelenght(s): 70cm

Not sure I've ever head of anyone who owned the equipment let alone used it, Given the 10mW power it's not surprising. I've included this out of curiosity.

## üá™üá∫ PMR446 analouge
* Modulation mode: FM
* Channel spacing: 12.5kHz
* SDR bandwidth: 12kHz
* Dongle mode: Direct off
* band: 446.0 to 446.2 MHz
* Wavelenght(s): 67cm
