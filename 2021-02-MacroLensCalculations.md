Macro Lens Calculations
===

Trying to work out which lens in my collection is best for macro photography with extension tubes.

# Terms
* f = Focal Lenght
* U = subject distance
* V = Image distance
* Mag = Magnification of lens
* LT = Lenght of Extension tube
* MagT = Magnification of lens & Extension tube
* I = Image Size
* S = Subject Size
* MFD = Minimum Focus Distance

# Formulas

## Focal Lenght:
1/f = (1/U) + (1/V)

## Magnification:
Mag = V/U 

## Magnification after adding an extension tube:
(LT / f ) + Mag = MagT

## Image size:
I = Mag x S
