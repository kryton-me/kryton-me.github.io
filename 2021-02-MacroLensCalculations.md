Macro Lens Calculations
===

Trying to work out which lens in my collection is best for macro photography with extension tubes. Rather than try them I thought I’d see if I could calculate the answer. Then potentially use this to work out which lens to buy next.

There are other methods to use non-macro lenses for macro photography however in this article I’m just considering Extension tubes.

# Terms
The following are the terms used in the calculations:

## f = [Focal Lenght](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length)
The measure of how a lens converges / diverges light.

## U = subject distance
Distance from the subject to a point in the lens. This is not the same a MFD.

## V = Image distance
Distance from the projected image to the to a point in the lens. This is not necessarily the same point U and depends on lens design. 

## Mag = Magnification of lens
To be considered “[macro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_photography)” this needs to be 1 or greater.

## LT = Lenght of Extension tube
The physical length of the extension tube / tubes from flange to flange.

## MagT = Magnification of lens & Extension tube
Magnification once a given lenght of extension tube has been applied to a given lens.

## I = Image Size
Size of the image projected on to the sensor of the camera

## S = Subject Size
Size of the subject the camera is pointing at.

# MFD = Minimum Focus Distance
Minimum distance the subject can be from the lens, not the same as U / subject distance.

# Formulas

## Focal Lenght:
1/f = (1/U) + (1/V)

## Magnification:
Mag = V/U 

## Magnification after adding an extension tube:
(LT / f ) + Mag = MagT

## Image size:
I = Mag x S

# Conclusion
Fundamentally the smallest focal length lens will always win however minimum focus distance may also have a factor here. 

For my 35mm sensor camera I can obtain a magnification factor of just over 1 using my 24mm and 28mm lenses with 26mm of extension tubes.

For my APS-C sensor camera I can obtain a factor of just over 1 with a 16mm lens and a 16mm extension tube. If however I use 26mm of tubes I can get a factor of around 1.7.

Of course 1.7 sounds better than 1 however it needs to be as a 35mm sensor is 1.5 times bigger than an APS-C. Also for a given number of pixels the 35mm sensor will have bigger pixels so will be less prone to noise.
