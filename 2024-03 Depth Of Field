Working out what factors of a lens / camera body govern the depth of field of an image.

# The two use cases: 

1. I want a shallow depth of field to use show the subject
2. I want a deep depth of field to show the hole scine

# Terms

### Apatute
often know as a "F" Number in photograthry. Also the term "T" number is sometimes used in more cinimatic contexts. To my understanding F numbers are calculated from the lenses design where "T" numbers are measured by sending light though a built lens. The latter being more accurite. For the purposes of the calcilation they will be used interchangeably.
