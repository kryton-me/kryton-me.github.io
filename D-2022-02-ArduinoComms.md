Arduino Comms
===
I often work on projects involving Arduino boards and it would be nice to get be able to communicate with them not requiring a laptop and a USB lead. The requirement here is to connect from a phone or tablet ideally with an IDE but a simply serial terminal would be sufficient.

# Potential methods of connecting to them.
Theas are my assumptions until I can probe otherwise. 

## USB lead
Power would potentially be a problem here depending on what output the device could offer here. This may require a tablet over a phone. sadly I've yet to find any software to support this approach. Resurch suggests Apple activly block this on iOS devices although there are some solutions.

## Bluetooth serial convection
There appear to be numerous apps available to suport a serial port over BLE. How do I get one working with an Arduino?

[This app looks promising](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bluetooth-for-arduino/id1505096526)

## IOT via Arduino cloud
This sounds like a good idea but requires an internet conection which is not going to be possible for my use case.
