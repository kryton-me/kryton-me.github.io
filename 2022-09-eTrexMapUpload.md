eTrex Maps
===
Having synced my old Garmin eTrex with modern fitness tracker apps. How do I get maps on it?

# Needed equipment
* Garmin eTrex 20/30 or simular 
* Apple iPad / iPhone
* Mac or Windows / Linux PC if using SD card.
* iPhone / some iPads: Lightning port to USB-A port adapter
* some iPads: USB-C to USB-A
* USB-A to USB-B Mini lead.
* sub 32GB SD card

# set up eTrex (do this once)
Same as the sync process set up, no need to repeat.
* On your eTrex, press back until you get the main menu
* Confirm the following settings 
* "Setup" -> "System" -> "USB Mode" -> Select "Garmin"
  * This enables access to the GPX files on the eTrex
* "Setup" -> "Tracks" -> "Auto Archive" -> Select "Daily"
  * This is optional
  * This splits the track up each day which is handy for finding a tour by date
  * If you do more than one tour a day or multi day trips probably best to manage this manually.

# Check format of the SD card (do this once)
* 32GB or less
* FAT32 format
  * This is all you need the PC or Mac for.
  * Called "MS-FAT" if formatting on a Mac.
* Has a directory in root called "GARMIN" 
  * Although its called "Garmin" on the GPS unit, suspect it's case insensative.

# Download a map file
* a scource of map Data for Garmin devices
  * [https://www.openfietsmap.nl/](Open Fiets Map) Free to download cycle map based on Open street map.
  * [https://shop.talkytoaster.me.uk/maps](Talky Toaster) High detail maps based on OSM & NASA. Pay for with free example map.
* In every case download the "GPS" format (.img) file not the basemap file.
* This will most likely be in a .zip file.
* Extract the zipfile.
* The file will possible be called "gmapsupp.img". This is important on older units but not for etrex20/30 or later so I understand.
* if you plane to have more than 1 map rename the file.
* drag the file to the "Garmin" directory of the GPS or the "GARMAN" directory of the SD card.
* once coppied reboot the GPS unit.

# Display map on GPS
* Either cycle via the back button or from the main menu open the map page.
* press Menu 
* select "Map options"?
* hope fully your map is on the list
* enable the map.
