eTrex Maps
===
Having synced my old Garmin eTrex with modern fitness tracker apps. How do I get maps on it?

# Needed equipment
* Garmin eTrex 20/30 or simular 
* Apple iPad / iPhone
* Mac or Windows / Linux PC if using SD card.
* iPhone / some iPads: Lightning port to USB-A port adapter
* some iPads: USB-C to USB-A
* USB-A to USB-B Mini lead.
* sub 32GB SD card

# set up eTrex (do this once)
Same as the sync process set up, no need to repeat.
* On your eTrex, press back until you get the main menu
* Confirm the following settings 
* "Setup" -> "System" -> "USB Mode" -> Select "Garmin"
  * This enables access to the Garmin directory on the eTrex.

# Check format of the SD card (do this once)
* 32GB or less
* FAT32 format
  * This is all you need the PC or Mac for.
  * FAT32 is "MS-DOS (FAT)" on a Mac.
* Has a directory in root called "GARMIN" or “garmin”
  * Appears to be case insensitive.

# Download a map file
* a source of map Data for Garmin devices
  * [Open Fiets Map](https://www.openfietsmap.nl/) Free to download cycle map based on Open street map.
  * [Talky Toaster](https://shop.talkytoaster.me.uk/maps) general map based on OSM & NASA. Pay for with free example map.
* In every case download the "GPS" format (.img) file not the basemap file.
* This will most likely be in a .zip file.
* Extract the zip file.
* The file will possible be called "gmapsupp.img". This is important on older units but not for etrex20/30 or later.
* If you plan to have more than one map rename each file so they can be in the same directory.
* Copy the file to the "Garmin" directory of the GPS or the "GARMAN" directory of the SD card.
* Once copied eject & reboot the GPS unit.

# Display map on GPS
* Open the map page.
* press Menu -> "Setup Map" -> "Map Information" -> "Select Map"
* Scroll to a map of intrest
* click on it, enable or diable it.
* press back to get back to the map.
