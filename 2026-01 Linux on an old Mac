Linux on an old MacBook Pro
---

# Introduction
I found an old MacBook Pro hanging around in need of somthing to do.

## Specs
* MacBook Pro 11,1 in Late 2013 spec
* Model: Number A1502
* CPU: intel "i5-4258U" 
* RAM: 8GB "Late 2013"

As it's well out of Apples support Stuck on MacOS 11 for eternity it's basically e-Waste well according to Apple. I however have other plans involving Linux.

# Which Linux?
Reading around it sounds like it should still be capable of running a current Distro as it's 64bit and a resnable spec. I'm a KDE fan and fancy trying out Fedora.

Distro: Fedora 43 KDE flavour

I set the iso file up on a USB pen drive as a live boot.

# First boot
Holding down the "Option" key or "alt" as its written on this particular MacBook I pressed the power button. This brought up the USB drive and 


# COPR build
Switch to copr build of Fedora? - Not sure I neede to do this.

"""sudo dnf copr enable dcaratti/wpa_supplicant sudo dnf update did not work"""

# Get Wifi working - Done

sudo dnf install

<https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm> -E %fedora).noarch.rpm <https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm> -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf config-manager setopt fedora-cisco-openh264.enabled=1

instal broadcom-wl

# Software to get the webcam working: - 

No attempted <https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd/wiki/Installation#get-started-on-fedora>  
TODO: My head hurts on this.

# VPN - 

just double click the file

# HIBERNATION - TODO Fix reboot issue.

Tried this using the UEFI method

<https://fedoramagazine.org/update-on-hibernation-in-fedora-workstation/>
Just reboots but does keep everything as is it had worked.
Assume Mac UEFI Issue.

# Keyboard

"Apple Aluminium (ANSI) or (ISO)"

delete = Fn + Backspace

€ = right "alt" + 2

\# = Right "alt" + 3

# Thermal issues

install the `lm_sensors` (`sudo dnf install lm_sensors)`

run `sensors-detect` 

use `sensors` 

```
sensors | grep -e "Core" -e "temp:" -e "RPM"
```

# Re-paste CPU

Upto 4th gen i5 "sudo dnf install libva-intel-driver"

Later "sudo dnf install intel-media-driver"

Software

sudo dnf install ffmpeg-free - already had it

sudo dnf install libavcodec-freeworld - H264

sudo dnf install libva-utils.x86_64

vainfo to confirm VA-API
