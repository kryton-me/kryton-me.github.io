Depth of Field
---

Working out what factors of a lens / camera body govern the depth of field of an image.

# The two use cases: 

1. I want a shallow depth of field to use show the subject
2. I want a deep depth of field to show the hole scine

# Terms

### Apatute (N)
Often know as a "F Number" in photograthry. Also the term "T number" is sometimes used in high end cinimatic lenses. To my understanding F numbers are calculated from the lenses design where "T" numbers are measured by sending light though a built lens. The latter being more accurite. For the purposes of the calcilation they will be used interchangeably.

### Focal Lenght (_f_)
The focal length of the lens, normall stated in "mm". Commonly a 50mm lense is used with a 35mm film stills or "full frame" camera.

_f_ not to be confised with the "F number".

### Distance to Subject (u)
How far is the lense from the subject. 

### Circle of confusion diameter (c)

I'll adopt the _d_/1500 calculation to simplify this.

| Sensor Size | CoC |
| 1" | 11μm |
| 4/3" | 15μm |
| APS-C | 18μm |
| 35mm | 29μm |

# Formulas

### Depth of field

DOC = (2* ( _u_ 2) * N * c)/ ( _f_ 2)

This suggests "F" number and Distance to subject have the largest effect.

# Conclusion
Doing some calculations on a spreadsheet agree with the above statment however _f_ focal lenght is a pritty big factor as well.
