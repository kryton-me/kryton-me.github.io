Small Camera
---

# Introduction
I'm looking for a camera to capture video of life as it happans. Something I can grab from my pocketand press go.

# Requirments
1 One button press to start video recording
2 Can operate with gloves
3 Focus should not be a worry
4 Can be left to do a time lapse
5 Usable low light perfomance
6 Fits in a pocket with ease
7 Stead shot technology
8 Wide point of view
9 Robust design
10 Not affraid of rain

# Types of camera

## Action Camera
Hits all the above requirments with the exception of low light, inherently they have small sensors so focus is fixed at 0.5m to infinity so is really not an issue. Most have very good stablisation.

## Compact Camera
There are a few compact cameras around that meet most of the requirments. Focus starts to become an issue as a lots are 1" sensors.

## Compact System cameras
This is where physical size becomes a constraint, and given that they're mostly a APS-C/35mm sensors you really need a very good Auto Focus. Sadly, at this point, you're also likely to lose shock resistance and water proof. However the low light will be a big step up due to larger sensors.

Small is not impossible in this type of camera. The early Sony NEX camers (Prior to the NEX-6) with the pancake 16mm lese were very small, but not weather or shock proof.

## Smart Phone
Smart phones do cover a lot of the requirements. However I haven't seen a handset wish a dedicated physicsl camera button since Nokia Symbian phones. Gloves are a pain and I wouldn't like to leave mine unattended while it's doing a Time-lapse!

## Conclusion on types
As much as I'd love the low light performance of a 35 mm sensor, combat, system, camera or the slick operation of a smart phone posting an image. I'm going to leave them at this point.

I have ignored 360 cameras as I'm not in to VR headsets and I don't fance the editing footage afterwards.

# Models to consider

1 GoPro Hero 
2 DJI Action 3
3 DJI Pocket 2
4 Insta RS One
5 Olympus TG6
6 Sony RX0

# GoPro Hero 11
Market leader of Action cameras, has a lot of complaints regards over heating when recording high resolutions / frame rates

# DJI Action 3 & Pocket 2
On the side-by-side videos I've seen, I don't think it has quite the dynamic range or colour rendition of the GoPro nor the Low light perfomence. 

Given its lower price, I'd be willing to forgive this however you have to register the handset with a very nosy phone app or it bricks the camera. This feels concerning to me Given DJI are part owned by the Chinese government. May be you think I wear a tin foil hat, but the US goverment has banned the use of their products. Most camera reviewers seem to ignor this aspect with the exception of EEEvlog.

## Insta RS One
Did not seem to get many reviews I could find and those that did seemed to preffer the GoPro / DJI products.

## Olympus TG6
This has a lot of features and offers a lot of options but from the reviews I've seen it's photo orientated and lacks a little in terms of Video. You can't even connect an external Microphone. 

## Sony RX0
Great camera with amazing outputs given its 1" sensor. The problem being you need to pre set the focus distance or keep part pressing the shutter button during the shot as it has no AF-C. This means I'm worrying about the focus not enjoying the moment. It's rulled out for this reasion.
