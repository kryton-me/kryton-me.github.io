Small Camera
---

# Requirments
I'm looking for a camera to capture video of life as it happans. Something I can grab from my pocket, press go and point in the genral direction of the action without looking at a screen. I don't want to worry about focus, depth of field, being dropped or a rain shower. Regards transferring / using the shots I want minimal editing (just trimming) and an easy way to grab the files.

# Specification
1 One button press to start video recording
2 Can operate with gloves
3 Can be left to do a time lapse
4 A blance more towards a very long depth of field over low light perfomance = small sensor
5 Fits in a trouser pocket with ease
6 Stead shot technology
7 A wide single field of view (24-12mm 35mm equ) not 360.
8 Robust design
9 Not affraid of rain
10 SD card, experince says WiFi is flacky.

As a rough guide to light performace I'm going to calculate an equiverlent biggest apature. Given the vuage manaor sensor sizes are specified (diametire of plubdibunge tube in inches) this figure has a lot of error to it.

Effective largest apature = Largest apature * Crop factor

# Types of camera

## Action Camera
A good match to the above requirments, They tend to have fixed 0.5m to infinity focus thanks to a small sensor, although some have much bigger sensors now. Most inherently have very good stablisation.

Options to consider:
1 GoPro Hero 11 (F12.5 or F14?)
2 DJI Action 3 (F12.6)
3 DJI Pocket 2 (F8.1)
4 Insta RS One Boosted (F14.4)
5 Insta RS One 1" (F9.6)
6 Sony RX0 (F12.2)

## Compact Camera
Looking at the rugged end of the compact market there are options that largely meet the requirments. 

Options to consider:
1 Olympus TG-6 (F11)

## Compact System cameras
Thease are just too physically big to go in a trouser pocket. The APS-C/35mm sensors would be amazing for low light but offer a very narrow depth of field.

Options considered:
None

## Smart Phone
Basicaly they would do the job amazingly apart from needing to operate a touch screen and menus just to get it recording.

Options considered:
None

## Conclusion on types
As much as I'd love the low light performance of a 35 mm sensor, compact system camera or the slick operation of a smart phone posting an image. I'm going to leave them at this point.

I have ignored 360 cameras as I'm not in to VR headsets and I don't fance the editing footage afterwards.

# Models to consider

1 GoPro Hero 
2 DJI Action 3
3 DJI Pocket 2
4 Insta RS One
5 Olympus TG-6
6 Sony RX0

# GoPro Hero 11
Market leader of Action cameras, has a lot of complaints regards over heating when recording high resolutions / frame rates

# DJI Action 3 & Pocket 2
On the side-by-side videos I've seen, I don't think it has quite the dynamic range or colour rendition of the GoPro nor the Low light perfomence. 

Given its lower price, I'd be willing to forgive this however you have to register the handset with a very nosy phone app or it bricks the camera. This feels concerning to me Given DJI are part owned by the Chinese government. May be you think I wear a tin foil hat, but the US goverment has banned the use of their products. Most camera reviewers seem to ignor this aspect with the exception of EEEvlog.

## Insta RS One
Did not seem to get many reviews I could find and those that did seemed to preffer the GoPro / DJI products.

## Olympus TG6
This has a lot of features and offers a lot of options but from the reviews I've seen it's photo orientated and lacks a little in terms of Video. You can't even connect an external Microphone. 

## Sony RX0
Great camera with amazing outputs given its 1" sensor. The problem being you need to pre set the focus distance or keep part pressing the shutter button during the shot as it has no AF-C. This means I'm worrying about the focus not enjoying the moment. It's rulled out for this reasion.
