Fairphone or shift phone any good?

# Fairphone


## past software support
These are Android devices and my biggest gripe with Android is the lack of Software support limiting the lifetime of the handset. 

### Fairphone
* Fairphone 1
  * 2013-12 but no official updates?
  * not sure I’ve fully understood this
  * iPhone 5S till iOS12.5.5 8years
* Fairphone 2
  * 2015-12 till Android 10
  * 4 years+?
  * iPhone 6S till iOS 15 7+ years?
* Fairphone 3
  * 2019-09 till Android 10
  * 1 Years+?
  * iPhone SE 2ndGen till current 3 years +?
* Fairphone 4
  * 2021-09 till 2025
  * 4 years

It looks they are matching iOS in terms of longevity of support although they seem to be behind the curve in terms of their current model being Android 11 yet it was released in 2020. 

Past performance looks good and a 4 year commitment upfront is certainly good compared to others.

### Shift phone


## Spec comparison 
Assuming the following options:
* 256GB of storage
* Best IP54
* USB-C connector

## Price
The fairphone 256GB variant being €649/£569 it certainly competes favourably with other devices.
