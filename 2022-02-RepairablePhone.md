Repairable phones
===

Given my biggest gripe about Android handsets is there short life due to poor software support I thought I’d look at the Fairphone or shift phone models. My first concern is Software patching lives i.e. I’d only use a phone while it’s getting security patches. 

# Software update history
In the table below I’ve added iPhone models resealed the same month or prior to the release of the handsets listed.

| Model | release date | lates software | date issued | period supported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fairphone 1 | 2013-12 | Android 4.2.2 (fairphone OS)| 2013-11 | -1? |
| iPhone 5S | 2013-09 | iOS 12.5.5 | 2021-09 | 8 years |
| Fairphone 2 | 2015-12 | Android 10 | 2022-02 | 7+ years |
| iPhone 6S | 2015-09 | iOS 15.3.1 | 2022-02 | 7+ years
| Shift6m | 2018-05 | Android 8 | 2021-04 | 3 years |
| iPhone X | 2017-11 | iOS 15.3.1 | 2022-02 | 7+ Years
| Fairphone 3 | 2019-09 | Android 10 | 2022-02 | 4+ years |
| iPhone 11 | 2019-09 | iOS 15.3.1 | 2022-02 | 2+ years
| Fairphone 4 | 2021-09 | Android 11 | 2025-09 | 4 years |

Sources: Wikipedia & manufacturers websites.

I have no idea if the lates Android release has made it on to fairphone or Shift6m devise as I don’t have one and can’t find any documentation. This is my best guess. I’ve only included the SHIFT6m as it’s the only one with a Wikipedia page. Fairphone seem to be doing OK assuming they are patching the handsets! The 4 year commitment upfront is certainly good compared to others.

# what else is missing?
Are there any aspects that differ from my iPhone bench mark? Given the “easy to repair” design I’d be interested to know the IP ratings of the handset.

I’ll bench mark to the closest price iPhone with 256GB.

| Model | inbuilt memory | connector | Price | IP rating | Screen ppi | Screen size | iFixit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iPhone 13 mini | 256GB | lightning | €929/£779 | IP68 | 467 | 5.4” | 6? |
| Fairphone 4 | 256GB | USB-C | €649/£569 | IP54 | 410 | 6.3” | 10 |

iFixit score assumed based on iPhone 12 mini & 13 pro both being 6

# Conclusion 
For me it’s about security and I need to find our how quickly it’s patched. If it’s close to iOS then it makes Apple hardware look over priced. However there are other things Apple offer such as your phone locked to your account meaning it’s useless if you steel it. I’ve not seen this mentioned and it looks like it’s possible to jail brake.
