Fairphone or shift phone any good?

# Fairphone


## past software support
These are Android devices and my biggest gripe with Android is the lack of Software support limiting the lifetime of the handset. 

* Fairphone 1
  * 2013-12 but no official updates?
  * not sure I’ve fully understood this
* Fairphone 2
  * 2015-12 till Android 10
  * 7 years
* Fairphone 3
  * 2019-09 till Android 10
  * 3 Years
* Fairphone 4
  * 2021-09 till 2025
  * 4 years

Past performance looks good and a 4 year commitment upfront is good.

## Spec comparison 
Assuming the following options:
* 256GB of storage
* 

* IP54

## Price
From £500 certainly competes favourably with other devices.
