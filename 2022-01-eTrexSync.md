eTrex sync
===
Syncing an old Garmin eTrex with modern fitness tracker apps. Yes I coild buy a modern device but where is the fun in that.

# Needed equipment
* Garmin eTrex assuming pre Bluetooth model
  * Tested on an eTrex 30
* Apple iPad / iPhone
* iPhone / some iPads: Lightning port to USB-A port adapter
* some iPads: USB-C to USB-A
* USB-A to USB-B Mini lead.
* Komoot app installed

# set up eTrex (do this once)
* On your eTrex, press back until you get the main menu
* Confirm the following settings 
* "Setup" -> "System" -> "USB Mode" -> Select "Garmin"
  * This enables access to the files on the eTrex
* "Setup" -> "Tracks" -> "Auto Archive" -> Select "Daily"
  * This is optional
  * This splits the track up each day which is handy for finding a tour by date
  * If you do more than one tour a day or multi day trips probably best to manage this manually.
