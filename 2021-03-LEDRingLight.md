# Why?
One hobby of mine is Macro Photography and light is always a strughle. I get my idea to do this from a bigclive.com video. After some explermemting with a set of LED lights on a copper string I got a good result with just leds and no deffuser.

# Requirments:
*High CRI rated LEDs >90

** 2000k is just manky yellow
* PTH LEDs
** Saves having to design a PCB
* Dimmable
** Being able to adjust the li
* USB powered
** Use USB batter pack
** 5.25 - 4.5V
** 0.5V driver drop?
** LED needs to drop less than 4V?
