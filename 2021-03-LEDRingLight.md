LED ring light
==============

# Why?
One hobby of mine is Macro Photography and light is always a struggle. I got my idea to do this from a bigclive.com video. After some explermemting with a set of LED lights on a copper string I got a good result with just leds and no deffuser.

# Requirments (some a bit Would Be Nice):
* High CRI rated LEDs >90
  * best for accurate photograpy results
* 4000k+ Colour Tempriture
  * For good daylight colour redition
  * Can then be used in daylight and not have problems
* PTH LEDs
  * Can fit the LEDs in to 5/3mm holes in a disc
  * Saves having to design a PCB
* Dimmable (WBN)
  * Being able to adjust the light level
* USB powered (WBN)
  * Use USB batter pack for portability
  * 5.25 - 4.5V
  * if no driver IC LED needs to oprate on 4.5V less resistor drop.

# Potential Components:
* LED driver [MAX6971ANG+](https://octopart.com/max6971ang%2B-maxim+integrated-40037352?r=sp)
* Struggled to find sutable LEDs PTH.

# First experiment
Feeling lazy I brought a 5m reel of 60 CRI90 4000K-4500K LEDs, On a strip. 

First experiment was to wrap it around the outside of a clear plastic tub with the LEDs facing inwards. It produced a good light however the heat build up was significant and I'm not sure much desuser efect was going on.

# Second experiment
My next experiment is to find a sutible section of some kind of pipe to put the strips around the inside. They have a self adhisive on the back so should be easy to apply.
