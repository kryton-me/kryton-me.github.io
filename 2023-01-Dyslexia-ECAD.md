Dyslexia & ECAD tools
---

Looking at ECAD tools and adapting them to make a Dyslexic's life easier

# KiCAD (6)

## Schematic editor with a black back ground

Preferences -> Preferences... -> Schematic Editor -> Colors

create a new "Theme" to your liking, basically "Background" is the key colour to change here.

The Symbol editor also uses the same settings.

## Windows in Dark Theme (Windows)
Can't find a setting for this, the OS is set to Dark but KiCAD is not, nor can I find a setting.

## Spell checker
Not found in Windows.

# Altium (22)

## Schematic sheet editor Dark background
This appears only possible on a sheet by sheet basis

For a given sheet:

Properties -> General -> General -> Sheet Color

Possibly worth setting things up via a sheet template if your colleagues are happy with this.
