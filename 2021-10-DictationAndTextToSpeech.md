# Windows TTS
Windows has a built in Text To Speech tool but there is no way to access it without using some form of software. To get around this I have released a basic Python script, A copy of the script can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kryton-me/PyWinTTS). It has been tested on Windows 10 and MacOS 11. I have released this under the MIT license for maximum compatibility.

Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/kryton-me/PyWinTTS/blob/main/README.md) file for full instructions on installation and use.
